Welcome to the Computational Linguistics / Corpus Linguistics repository.


Date: Tue Jan 27 2015

This repository contains 2 tools for text analysis:
1 Word Counter - an application written in Excel VBA for counting word frequencies.
2 Vocab Profiler - this tool allows for profiling texts based on selected lexical resources. This is DEBUG version. I banged this app out in one afternoon and never really finished it. That means it's slow (crappy lookup algorithm), code is ugly and the app has some bugs when calculating statistics.

Note
These tools were written years ago and are no longer developed.
