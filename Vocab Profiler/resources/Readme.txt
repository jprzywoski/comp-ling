1. Description
This Word VBA application was developed as a tool for visually validating corpus based wordlist as well as profiling texts. Checking the texts against user defined wordlists is also possible. That also allows cross comparison of two different texts in terms of lexical overlap.
The app will run in all versions of Word; however in Word 2007/10 the speed of code execution is much lower then in Word 2003.
Important!
Do not delete any of the wordlists in the resources folder.

2. Word lists
All the wordlist has been downloaded from the internet.
First group of wordlist (BNC) comes from Paul Nation’s application Range available at: http://www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/about/staff/paul-nation
This set of wordlist is a collection of fourteen thousand most common word types and their derived word forms, ranked according to their frequency. It is based on data from British National Corpus. The next six thousand word types were downloaded from:

The General Service List and Academic Word List came from:

University Word List was downloaded from Wikipedia.
Television Word list comes from:
WHAT'S IN A TELEVISION WORD LIST? A CORPUS-INFORMED INVESTIGATION

Oxford word lists can be found in Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.

2.1 BNC
The British National Corpus (BNC) is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of British English from the later part of the 20th century, both spoken and written.

2.2 AWL
The Academic Word List (AWL) was developed by Averil Coxhead as her MA thesis at the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The list contains 570 word families which were selected according to principles. The list does not include words that are in the most frequent 2000 words of English. The AWL was primarily made so that it could be used by teachers as part of a programme preparing learners for tertiary level study or used by students working alone to learn the words most needed to study at tertiary institutions. The Academic Word List replaces the University Word List.

2.3 GSL
The General Service List (GSL) is a list of roughly 2000 words published by Michael West in 1953. The words were selected to represent the most frequent words of English and were taken from a corpus of written English. The target audience was English language learners and ESL teachers. To maximize the utility of the list, some frequent words that overlapped broadly in meaning with words already on the list were omitted. 

2.4 UWL
The University Word List (UWL) is a list of vocabulary items common in academic texts. It is composed of 808 words, divided into 11 levels. This list is designed to be a list of specialized vocabulary for students who know about 2,000 generally common words and plan to study in an English-language college or university. Think of it as the most common 800 words in academic texts excluding the 2,000 words of the General Service List (GSL) (West, 1953). This list is linked to the GSL. If your students study the GSL, followed by the UWL, there should be no repetition.

2.5 TSL
The goal of the study was to identify, analyze and compile a list of specialized vocabulary that occurred frequently in a 500,000-word TV corpus and to determine whether this list could potentially boost learners’ comprehension of TV talk and thereby support the learning of new words. A 689-word Television Word List (TWL) was created following procedures used by Coxhead (2000). In comparing the TWL to the other lists, the TWL appears to be a useful specialized list that provides 1 to 2% coverage of TV talk depending on the particular show.

2.6 Oxford Business and finance words
These are the 250 most common words (apart from the Oxford 3000) in writing that deals with business and finance. Knowing them will help you to understand texts about these subjects more easily.

2.6 Oxford Science words
These are the 250 most common words (apart from the Oxford 3000) in writing that deals with science subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.). Knowing them will help you to understand texts about these subjects more easily.

2.6 Oxford Arts words
These are the 250 most common words (apart from the Oxford 3000) in writing that deals with arts subjects (literature, painting, music, etc.). Knowing them will help you to understand texts about these subjects more easily.

3. User Defined Wordlists
There are two types of user defined wordlists that can be used with the program.
First option, available under 'Create Custom Wordlist' menu item allows to create a wordlist containing all the word types along with associated derived words based on the input text sample - it can be any text - program automatically converts the text into right format. The wordlists is then stored as 'UserDefined.txt' in the main folder. It can be later accessed by checking 'User Defined' box.
Second option, under 'Custom List' - loads selected text into program, converts it into right format, but doesn't add any derived word forms.
Important!
In Word 2007-2010 file filter doesn't seem to work, you should only choose text files (.txt) as a source for user defined word lists.
